=head1 NAME

CatalystX::Features::Backend - All the dirty work is done here

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $backend = $c->features;

	$backend->list; # a list of features

	$backend->config; # my config 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $c->features->config()

Returns the config hash part related to L<CatalystX::Features>.

=head2 $c->features->init()

Initializes the backend, searching for features and creating L<CatalystX::Features::Feature> instances for them. 

=head2 $c->features->find( file=>'filename.ext' )

Returns the feature that contains a file.

=head2 $c->features->list()

Returns an array with instances of all loaded features. If they have not changed via config, they'll be instances of the L<CatalystX::Features::Feature> class.

=head2 $c->features->get( $feature_name ) 

Get the object instance of a given feature name. 

=head2 $c->features->me()

Not implemented yet.

=head1 TODO 

=over

=item A $c->features->me method which can be called from within a feature to get it's own instance.
