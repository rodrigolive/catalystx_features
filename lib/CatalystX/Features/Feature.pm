=head1 NAME

CatalystX::Features::Feature - Class that represents a single feature.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.10

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    foreach my $feature( $c->features ) {
        $c->log->info( $feature->name );  # $feature methods declared here
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the object you get when you list features with $c->features.

=head1 METHODS

This is how this class implements the required interfaces from the role L<CatalystX::Features::Role::Feature>.

=head2 id

For a feature directory of "my.feature_1.0", the id part is "my.feature_1.0".

=head2 name

For a feature directory of "my.feature_1.0", the name is "my.feature".

=head2 version

For a feature directory of "my.feature_1.0", the version is "1.0".

=head2 version_number

A version long integer that can be compared easily. For a feature directory of "my.feature_1.2.3", the version number equals 001002003.

=head1 TODO

=head2 Change the base class name thru config

Not everyone want to have this object as a base class for their features. There is a role (interface) already created in case you want to create your own class from scratch.
